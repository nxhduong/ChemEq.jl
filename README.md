To balance a chemical equation using matrix operations, we first need to represent the equation as a system of linear equations. 
We can do this by creating a matrix that represents the coefficients of the elements in each compound. 
For example, consider the following equation: 

`CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O`

We can represent this equation as a system of linear equations:

```
C: 1x + 0y - 1z = 0
H: 4x + 0y - 2w = 0
O: 2y - 2z - 1w = 0
```

where `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are the coefficients of `CH4`, `O2`, `CO2`, and `H2O`, respectively. 
The first equation represents the conservation of carbon atoms, 
the second equation represents the conservation of hydrogen atoms, 
and the third equation represents the conservation of oxygen atoms.

We can represent this system of linear equations as a matrix:

```
1 0 -1 0
4 0 0 -2
0 2 -2 -1
```

Each row corresponds to an equation and each column corresponds to a compound. 
The first column corresponds to `CH4`, the second column corresponds to `O2`, 
the third column corresponds to `CO2`, and the fourth column corresponds to `H2O`.

To solve for the coefficients of the balanced equation, we need to find the nullspace of the matrix. 
The nullspace of a matrix is the set of all vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, result in a zero vector. 
In other words, balancing a chemical equation requires finding the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` that satisfy the system of linear equations.
